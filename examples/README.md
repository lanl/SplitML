## Examples

This directory contains example scripts and notebooks.

### Autoencoder: `AE_training.ipynb`
Demonstrate autoencoder training on synthetic data. Uses `AE_training_functions.py`.

### Baseline methods: `Baseline_Methods.ipynb`
Demonstrate baseline methods (wavelets, SSA, and temporal deconvolution/maximum likelihood) on synthetic data.

### ConvTasNet: `CTN_evaluation.ipynb`
Demonstrates pre-trained ConvTasNet on synthetic data; first run `CTN_training.py` to train a model.

### DCCRN: `DCCRN_evaluation.ipynb`
Demonstrates performance of pre-trained DCCRN on synthetic data; first run `fit_dccrn_dualreal.py` followed by `load_dccrn_apply_test.py` to gather performance across hyperparameters.

### Transfomer: `Transformer_training.ipynb`
Demonstrates transformer model training on synthetic data. Uses `Transformer_training_functions.ipynb`.
